airplane_ticket.aut is generated from the mCRL2 example with N=100
airplane_ticket_red.aut is generated from the mCRL2 example with n=100 and then reduced modulo probabilistic bisimulation
airplane_ticket2-x.aut is generated from the mCRL2 example with an additional enter action at the start with N=x
ant_on_grid.aut is generated from the mCRL2 example
ant_on_grid2.aut is generated from the mCRL2 example but with the step action before the dist operator instead of after
ant_on_grid3.aut is generated from the mCRL2 example but with the step action before the dist operator instead of after and with switched coordinates such they are correct along the definition of the problem
